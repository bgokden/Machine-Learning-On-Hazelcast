Machine Learning On Hazelcast
=============================

Simple Machine Learning implementations on Hazelcast MapReduce API

ML API is in its early days right now and it only supports kNN.

I have added a way add your own objects with using annotations and adding distance calculation method.

Recommendation Method based on co-occurence matrix is next in line to be supported.

I am planning to support most of the methods supported by Apache Mahout.

NOTE: There was an issue with serialization I have fixed it and changed the way how my api works.
