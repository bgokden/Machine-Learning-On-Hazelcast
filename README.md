Machine Learning On Hazelcast
=============================

Simple Machine Learning implementations on Hazelcast MapReduce API

ML API is in its early days right now and it only supports kNN.

Recommandation Method based on co-occurence matrix is next in line to be supported.

I am planning to support most of the methods supported by Apache Mahout.

NOTE: There is an issue with serialization so I am trying to fix it before continuing to add new functionality.
